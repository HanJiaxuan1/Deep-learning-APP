## Sud.DL
This study successfully constructed a website using open-source tools, centered on simplifying the deployment of NLP deep learning tasks. While ensuring multifunctionality and user-friendliness, the platform also notably reduced user challenges both in terms of deployment functionality usage and its associated learning curve. 

### Content
In this project, Python Django, PyTorch, Transformers, JavaScript, Docker, and Alibaba Cloud are used to build the SUD.DL. Following the Django project structure, the detailed back-end code can be found in the 'deeplearningapp' file. In addition, the frond-end code and related files can be found in the 'statics' and 'templates' files. Additionally, it is noted that all models in the 'model' file do not include the corresponding model bin file, as the size of these files are too large. If you want to use the model bin files, you can download them on the Hugging Face.

### Expirement Result
By setting up SUD.DL, against the prevalent no-code deep learning deployment solution, Hugging Face, undertook comparative experiments and surveys. 
Data-driven analysis was employed to discern the
tangible advancements of SUD.DL over its counterpart. The results confirmed that
SUD.DL has made significant strides in aesthetics, facilitating users to easily
locate deployment-related functions reduce the learning curve and
comprehension difficulty associated with deployment tutorials. Although thereâ€™s
room for further optimization in model deployment times and the complexity of
the development process, SUD.DL achieved commendable outcomes in overall user
satisfaction
